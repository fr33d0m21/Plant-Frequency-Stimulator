Plant Sound Stimulation App
The Plant Sound Stimulation App is an interactive Python-based application that allows users to experiment with audio frequencies to stimulate the growth and well-being of plants. The application uses a graphical user interface to provide an easy-to-use platform for horticulturists, plant enthusiasts, and researchers to explore the effects of sound on plant growth and development.

Features
Adjustable audio frequency generator for generating tones between 50 Hz and 900 Hz
Real-time frequency display and control through a slider
Play, stop, and duration controls for generating and controlling audio tones
Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo (or GPT-4, if available) for providing information on optimal frequencies for different plant species and growth stages
An interactive chat-like interface for asking questions and receiving AI-generated answers about plants and their specific requirements
Cross-platform compatibility, built using the Tkinter library
Use Cases
Experiment with the effects of audio frequencies on plant growth, germination, stress reduction, photosynthesis enhancement, flowering induction, and more
Find optimal frequencies for specific plant species based on their unique requirements
Facilitate research on the impact of sound on plant development and well-being
Educate users about the benefits of sound stimulation in plants
Installation
To use the Plant Sound Stimulation App, follow the instructions in the project's README file to set up a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the application.
