# Plant Frequency Stimulator

Plant Frequency Stimulator is a desktop application that generates sound frequencies to stimulate plant growth. It is developed using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The application also features integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to provide users with information on specific plant species and their optimal frequencies for various growth stages.

## Features

- Adjustable frequency slider for generating sound frequencies between 50 Hz and 900 Hz.
- Play button for generating the selected frequency.
- GPT-3.5-turbo integration for providing information on plant species and their optimal frequencies.
- Ability to ask questions about plant species and receive answers from the AI.

## Installation

To run the Plant Frequency Stimulator application, you need to have Python 3.7 or later installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application with the following command:

```
python plantgen.py
```

## Usage

1. Use the frequency slider to select the desired frequency.
2. Click the "Play" button to generate the selected frequency.
3. To ask the AI about a specific plant species or any related questions, type your question into the text field and click the "Ask" button. The AI will provide an answer in the text area below the input field.
